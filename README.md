# Model-Serie-A-2021-22

The objective of this project is to present a simple method with good predictive quality, easy implementation, low computational effort that allows the calculation
of the interest probabilities: which team will be the champion, which ones will be relegated, which ones will qualify to another tournament, which team will be the
best home team, which team will be the best away team by recreating the model explained in the paper "Predicting Match Outcomes in the English Premier League: Which Will Be the Final Rank?" on the Italian Championship Serie A 2021-22.
In this project we estimate the average goals scored by each team by assuming that the number of goals scored by a team in a match
follows a univariate Poisson distribution, and we consider linear models that express the sum and the difference of goals scored in terms of five covariates: 
the goal average in a match, the home team advantage, the team’s offensive power, the opponent team’s defensive power.
